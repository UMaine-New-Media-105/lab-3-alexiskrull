thirdExercise.js
This file is the same simple candy shape with a function, but this function now takes 6 parameters: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and 4 different colors. The x- and y-coordinates move the shape, while the 4 colors are the colors than the shape changes to at certain positions of the mouse's x-coordinate.
